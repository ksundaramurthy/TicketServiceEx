README 

To Build this project you can use either eclipse or commandline. Also I have written comments against each method
which explains the functionality.

I have used Spring to inject the dependencies and used Java Config style for Spring Beans.

I have coded without tables/persistance mechanism and this project doesnt have any UI code.

Build in Command Line:
1.Download the project
2.Use maven to buid
	mvn clean install
	
Please note that I have written a simple test class, I need to expand it to cover all the scenarios.
